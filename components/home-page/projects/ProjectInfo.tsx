      <br />
      <p>
        I&apos;m an aspiring full-stack developer with a growing passion for web
        technologies and user experience design. My journey into web development
        began through online courses and personal projects, where I discovered
        my love for creating interactive applications.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        I&apos;m currently focused on building a strong foundation in both
        frontend and backend technologies. Each project I work on teaches me
        something new, and I&apos;m constantly challenging myself to learn and
        apply new concepts.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        I&apos;m eager to join a development team where I can continue learning,
        contribute to meaningful projects, and grow into a skilled full-stack
        developer.
